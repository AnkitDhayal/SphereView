# Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) Implementation in Qt and OpenGL

This repository contains an implementation of Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) using Qt and OpenGL in Visual Studio. CAGD is a field of study that deals with the mathematical representation and manipulation of curves and surfaces, commonly used in computer graphics and CAD applications.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) - A cross-platform application framework.
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - A graphics rendering API.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - An integrated development environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Open the Visual Studio solution file (cagd-qt-opengl.sln) in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution to compile the CAGD application.

4. Run the application to see the CAGD implementation in action.

## Features
Curve Generation: Implementations of various curves such as Bézier curves, B-splines, etc.

Surface Generation: Algorithms for generating surfaces like Bézier surfaces, NURBS surfaces, etc.

Interactive Visualization: Use Qt and OpenGL for interactive visualization of curves and surfaces.

User Interaction: Allow users to manipulate and control the curves and surfaces using mouse and keyboard input.
