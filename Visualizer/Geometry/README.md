# Geometry Project with Line, Point, Shape, and Triangle Classes

This C++ project provides a basic implementation of geometric entities, including Line, Point, Shape, and Triangle classes. These classes are designed to facilitate common geometric operations and computations.

## Classes

### 1. Point

The `Point` class represents a point in a 2D space with x and y coordinates.

### 2. Line

The `Line` class represents a straight line segment connecting two points in a 2D space.

### 3. Shape

The `Shape` class serves as a base class for various geometric shapes. It provides common functionality and properties.

### 4. Triangle

The `Triangle` class is derived from the `Shape` class and represents a triangle defined by three points.
