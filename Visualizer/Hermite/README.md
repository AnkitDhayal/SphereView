# Hermite Curve Implementation in C++

This C++ project provides an implementation of the Hermite curve, a mathematical spline curve used in computer graphics and CAD applications. The Hermite curve is defined by its control points and tangent vectors at those points, allowing for precise control over the curve's shape.

## Hermite Curve Features

- **Hermite Curve Generation:** Implementation of the Hermite curve algorithm.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Visualize the Hermite curve using a simple application.
- **User Interaction:** Allow users to manipulate control points and tangent vectors to observe real-time changes in the Hermite curve.
