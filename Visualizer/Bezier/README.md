# Bezier Curve Implementation in Qt and OpenGL

This repository contains an implementation of Bezier curves using Qt and OpenGL in Visual Studio. Bezier curves are widely used in computer graphics and CAD applications for smooth and intuitive curve design.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) - A cross-platform application framework.
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - A graphics rendering API.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - An integrated development environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Build the solution to compile the Bezier Curve application.

3. Run the application to visualize and interact with Bezier curves.

## Features

- Bezier Curve Generation: Implementation of Bezier curve algorithms.

- Interactive Visualization: Utilizes Qt and OpenGL for interactive visualization of Bezier curves.

- User Interaction: Allows users to manipulate and control Bezier curves using mouse and keyboard input.
